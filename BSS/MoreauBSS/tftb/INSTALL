Installing TFTB -- the Time-Frequency toolbox
-----------------------------------------------------------

1/ Get the sources from http://www.nongnu.org/tftb/

2/ Uncompress the tarball

3/ You don't need to compile anything to start using the TFTB.
   You just have to adjust the path of GNU Octave or Matlab (R).

Say that you put the sources in the following directory:

/home/myself/my_path/tftb

GNU Octave
----------

Add the following line to your ~/.octaverc

addpath(genpath("/home/myself/my_path/tftb"));

or type this command at Octave's prompt each time you start a new session.

The following OctaveForge packages are required: signal and optimization.

Matlab (R)
----------

Use 'Set path' dialog box or type

addpath("/home/myself/my_path/tftb");

at Matlab's prompt each time you start a new session.

-----------------------------------------------------------

You can compile a version of the Reference Guide from
the source. Run make in the directory refguide/.
You need to have a complete LaTeX distribution running
on your computer.

Descriptions of the different MATLAB scripts in the folder scriptsBSS:
- `JEFASBSS_SynthMix.m`: performs JEFAS-BSS on a synthetic nonstationary mixture and compares its performances with baseline BSS algorithms.
- `JEFASBSS_SynthMixs.m`: performs JEFAS-BSS on 20 realizations of a same synthetic nonstationary mixture. Two performances indexes are evaluated and compared with baseline BSS algorithms.
- `JEFASBSS_SynthMixsOVerDeterm.m`: performs JEFAS-BSS on a synthetic nonstationary mixture when the number of observations is larger than the number of sources.
- `JEFASBSS_sounbd.m`: performs JEFAS-BSS on a synthetic mixture of real nonstationary audio sources.
